Screeps Notes
=================

What happens in Screeps

Pick spawn location (don't need to worry about this for now can be done manually)
Spawn creeps (how will spawns pick what type of creeps)
Creep actions (list all creep actions then implementations)
Plan layouts (most difficult manual process to begin with?)
Labs
Market

================
Spawn creeps
================

what level are you? 
What should you be looking for?
What does the economny need?
What resources are in the room?
What resources should we build creeps for/
What is the most efficient number of creeps to spawn?
Decide what creeps to spawn


=====================
Creep actions
=====================

What actions do creeps do
All are defined within api
what roles do they perform>

Body part priority
TARCWMCH

Miner > C,W,W,W,W,M,M
Harvester > 
Carrier > 
Worker > C,W,M
Upgrader > 
filler > C,M
Builder > W,C,M
Claimer > M,C
Repairer
Healer > ARHM
Archer > ARRRRMH
Soldier > AAAARMH
Scout > ARWMMMMMMH
Tank? > TTTTTARMH
Sapper
spook > M

==================
Buildings
================
Only roads can be built in unowned rooms

What to Build
When to build it
Who should build it

Container
==========
Container mining


controller
=============
Can't build but can claim
can only claim enough rooms as GCL dictates
Controller maximum level 8
Watch ticks until downgrade to stop lvl degradation
You can reserve a controller
you can only reserve a controller up to 5000 reservation points
1 claim part will give 1 reservation point. 
1 reservation point is burned every tick
need a creep with 1 or more claim parts. (some calculations need to be done for viability/profits) 
Should upgrade whenever you can
if fully upgraded and nothing else to fill still upgrade implementations

extension
==========
Used to store more energy for spawner to create more creeps
will need to be placed on route to spawn from source

extractor
===============
harvesting mineral requires an extractor
required rcl6

keeperlair
==========
can't build this but need to keep in mind the posability 

Labs
====
No point until rcl6

link
====
energy is transferred to another link in the room
loss of 3% energy. need to calculate energy spent hauling vs 3% loss
cool down of 1 tick per unit of distance from target

nuker
=======
late level no need

observer
==========


powerbank
power spawn
portal

rampart
============
A rampart is a structure where own creeps can hide to protect against enemies.
Costs 500 points to build, taking 100 ticks to build with one WORK body part costing 500 energy.
Loose 300 hit points every 100 ticks. Can be repaired by 100 points per tick per one WORK bodypart (costs 1 energy per WORK bodypart).
usually build a wall with rampart in the middle

road
==========
A road tile takes 300 points to build, which means 60 ticks to build with a single WORK body part and costs of 300 energy.
When a road is built and has less then full hits it can be repaired with a creep with WORK and CARRY components with energy by using the .repair() command
Decreases movement cost to 1. Using roads allows creating creeps with less MOVE body parts.
Cost

300 at plain land
1,500 at swamp
Hits

5,000 at plain land
25,000 at swamp
Decay

Loses 100 hits every 1,000 ticks at plain land
Loses 500 hits every 1,000 ticks at swamp
Note: every creep step decreases the decay timer for 1 tick per each creep body part

spawn
==============
can give 300 energy for creep
each extension +50

// replace swtich below with this
let extensionCount = CONTROLLER_STRUCTURES[STRUCTURE_EXTENSION][room.controller.level]
//

let extensions = room.find(FIND_MY_STRUCTURES, { filter: (s) => s.structureType == STRUCTURE_EXTENSION });
let extensionCount;
switch (room.controller.level) {
case 2:
  extensionCount = 5;
  break;
case 3:
  extensionCount = 10;
  break;
default:
  extensionCount = (room.controller.level - 2) * 10;
  break;
}
if (extensions.length >= extensionCount) {
  room.memory.mode = room.memory.nextmode;
}


storage
==============
used to store excess energy
Cannot be used by spawn for creeps

terminal
=========
used for markets now necessary until later levels

tower
============
Remotely attacks or heals creeps, or repairs structures. 
Can be targeted to any object in the room. 
However, its effectiveness highly depends on the distance. 
Each action consumes energy.


wall
=======
any but need to calculate most effective location
